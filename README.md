# all_about_provider

This is a basic app which uses provide as state management. 
## Getting Started

In this app there is basically just two screens. In first screen, there are list of names of famous person and there is an icon button where you can follow it.
And in second screen, there basically comes the names of people you decided to follow in the first screen. 

This app just shows the basic usages of provider as a state management where there is a event where you click on the icon of the person of the first screen and it gets added in the next screen. & if it is already added, it gets removed from the screen. The logic of this application is very easy to understand.
